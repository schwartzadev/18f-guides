# This file defines what approvals are needed to update both code and content.
#
# GitHub will automatically tag these people for review when anyone opens a pull request,
# so no need to use this file directly unless you are updating it.
# 
# The 18F Chief of Delivery, as Product Owner, is ultimately accountable for keeping
# this list up-to-date. If you spot anything outdated or are handing off your responsibility, 
# feel free to make changes to this file and open a pull request, file an issue on GitHub,
# or notify the Chief of Delivery. 
# 
# There are no additional approvals needed outside of those listed in this document. Of
# course, feel free to request a review of your changes from anyone who you would like,
# given the content of the changes you are making.

# Unless another rule applies below, request review from someone on the TLC crew 
# or the Chief of Delivery.
