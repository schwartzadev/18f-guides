    methods_categories is a hash, so the object in the iteration is a key/values array.
    obj[0] is the key, which can be used as a slugified version of the category name.
    obj[1] is the category values object.
  {% endcomment %}
  {% assign category_slug = obj[0] %}
  {% assign category = obj[1] %}
  {% include "methods/homepage-category.html" category_slug: category_slug category: category %}
{% endfor %}
