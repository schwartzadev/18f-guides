description: "How user experience (UX) designers at 18F approach their work, from conducting research to building prototypes."
---
18F user experience (UX) designers join cross-functional teams to improve interactions between government agencies and the people they serve. The 18F UX Guide helps us get this job done. It’s a starting point for UX design at 18F: doing it, discussing it, and ensuring it’s done to a consistent level of quality.

## What this guide is

Like [our content guide]({{ '/content-guide/' | url }}), the 18F UX guide is written for our internal designers, but we hope it’s a useful reference for anyone. Our working assumptions for this guide include that 18F UX designers are expected to possess, among other things:

* design research skills
* the ability to skillfully navigate organizational relationships
* the ability to deliver artifacts that guide development, like wireframes and prototypes

This guide includes information that may be new to the designers we hire (who may be new to government), and useful starting points for conversations with the people we work with (who may be new to UX design). For details of specific UX activities and how to conduct them, see [18F's methods](https://18f-guides.netlify.app/methods/).

18F staff should consult additional guidance:

* [TTS Handbook page on doing research at Technology Transformation Services](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/research-guidelines/)
* [New Hire README](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19naJ8wgVo_hnv_nUy2WWyzH6DJwXXgenD0QpsZmOSe0/edit#)
* [Project Start Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jFGksReKrt2PY_QVe7fj1aOCcyjHlGPf5hkKgv7nuMA/edit?pli=1#)
* [Before You Ship guide](https://before-you-ship.18f.gov/)


## How to use this guide

We created this guide for our reference. It’s here for a refresher on [ways to protect research participant privacy]({{ 'research/privacy/' | url }}), or for quick access to [design-related templates, presentations, etc.]({{ '/ux-guide/resources/' | url }}) You’re also welcome to read it from start to finish if you like.

This guide is divided into three sections:
- **Our Approach** describes essential components that shape our design practice: our [team values and principles]({{ 'our-approach/values-and-principles/' | url }}), our [definitions of design]({{ 'our-approach/defining-design/' | url }}), and our commitment to [staying lean]({{ 'our-approach/stay-lean/' | url }}). It also describes how we [meet partners where they are]({{ 'our-approach/meet-partners-where-they-are/' | url }}).
- **Research** describes the process by which we systematically frame problems, explore options, and evaluate solutions. It includes articles on research [basics]({{ 'research/clarify-the-basics/' | url }}) (working definitions) and how we [plan]({{ 'research/plan/' | url }}), [do]({{ 'research/do/' | url }}), and [analyze, synthesize, and share]({{ 'research/make-research-actionable/' | url }}) research.
- **Design** describes how we communicate and clarify what we’re building throughout the design process. It includes articles on how we [build prototypes]({{ 'design/build-a-prototype/' | url }} ) and [use design systems]({{ 'design/use-a-design-system/' | url }}).
